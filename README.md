## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build web apps that do more than just load and run — they scale well, perform fast, and solve real problems.

Most of my work is with startups that need full-stack solutions — from backend architecture to frontend UI, third-party integrations, and deployment. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and making sure the product works well in real-world use.

I’ve been doing this for 5+ years now, both independently and as part of teams. Many of the apps I’ve built are in production today, used by real users — from live video editors to secure payroll tools.

## 🤝 How I Work

- I take ownership of the work — from start to finish
- I give clear updates and communicate like a teammate, not just a coder
- I look for edge cases, performance issues, and better ways to do things
- I don’t rely on buzzwords or magic tools — I build stuff that works
